Learning.....always learning
Learning stuff in computer science is like always having laundry to do, only more fun.  And, the sooner you get comfortable with the idea that learning will NEVER END......... you'll find your happy place.  

I am a friend of technology and happy to be close to a keyboard.  Coding is bliss.
